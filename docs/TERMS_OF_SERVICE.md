# Terms of Service for KintaMed Edge ⚖️

**Last Updated: January 23, 2026**

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the KintaMed Edge application. This application is designed specifically for **Community Health Workers (CHWs)** operating in remote or disaster-stricken environments.

---

## 1. Scope of Service
KintaMed Edge provides an **offline-first AI-driven diagnostic assistant**. It is intended to support, not replace, the clinical judgment of health workers.

## 2. MANDATORY EXPERT APPROVAL ⚠️
**CRITICAL: KintaMed Edge is a decision-support tool, NOT a diagnostic medical device.**

- **Professional Verification**: Every triage suggested, reasoning provided, or differential diagnosis generated by the AI **MUST be reviewed and approved by a qualified medical expert** (Doctor, Nurse Practitioner, or Senior Specialist) before any final clinical action, treatment, or evacuation is executed.
- **Worker Responsibility**: CHWs must use the AI output as one of many inputs, prioritizing local clinical protocols and physical examination findings over AI suggestions.

## 3. Intended Use
This app is for use by trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) and medical personnel in:
- Remote areas with no internet connectivity.
- Disaster zones / Conflict regions.
- Field hospitals where specialist access is limited.

## 4. Nature of AI (MedGemma)
- **Experimental Technology**: The AI models (MedGemma/Gemma) are experimental. While fine-tuned for clinical reasoning, they may produce "hallucinations" or incorrect medical advice.
- **Non-Diagnostic**: The app suggests "probabilities" and "categories" based on ingested data. It does not provide a definitive diagnosis.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developers of KintaMed Edge shall not be liable for:
- Any clinical errors or adverse patient outcomes resulting from the use of the app.
- Decisions made regarding patient evacuation or treatment based on AI output.
- Data loss due to hardware failure or device theft.

## 6. Device Security
Users are solely responsible for:
- Maintaining the physical security of the tablet or laptop.
- Setting strong device-level passwords/biometrics.
- Ensuring the device is used in a private setting to maintain patient dignity and confidentiality.

## 7. Modifications to Service
We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the application or its AI models at any time. Users are encouraged to keep their local model weights updated when periodic internet access is available.
